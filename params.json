{"body":"### pdf.js : Cross-browser `fillRule` support\r\n\r\nThe pdf.js project is an surprisingly good PDF viewer that runs in JavaScript within your web browser without needing any plugins.  I recently discovered this project when working on PDF print previews for a completely unrelated website.  I noticed that pdf.js worked better on the PDFs I was generating within Mozilla Firefox than within Google Chrome because of the lack of the `fillRule` attribute in the WebKit rendering engine.  See [pdf.js issue 2351](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/issues/2351).\r\n\r\nI decided to try to fix this by adding support for `fillRule` to WebKit:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jwal/webkit/commit/6ec4200dcb5c23545cacd371de5137bf1326bec1\r\n\r\nThis repository houses a small fork of pdf.js which can use the non-standard `webkitFillRule` property of the canvas, which I am adding, or the `mozFillRule` property which is already present and fully implemented in production Firefox builds.  These GitHub pages are also being used as free web hosting for the original and modified versions of pdf.js which demonstrate the issue and part of the solution.","note":"Don't delete this file!
